# Unity_Escape_Room
A VR escape room game created using Unity for Stanford's EE267 final project. 

The game is adapted for the View-Master Deluxe VR Viewer. 
Tracked usersâ€™ heads with an IMU mounted on the VR headset, specifically tracking orientation using the VRduino.
The VRduino is a custom hardware for position tracking, which incorporates an IMU and Teensy. 
Teensy provides the proper support circuitry for the photodiodes used with the HTC Vive Lighthouses. 

Created during COVID-19 as a proof of concept of creating engaging, enjoyable VR 3D escape games. See the written report for more details on project description, motivation, game outline, and game images.
